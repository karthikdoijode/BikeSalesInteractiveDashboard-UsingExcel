# BikeSalesInteractiveDashboard-UsingExcel
Analyzing data and building an interactive dashboard using charts and pivot tables

Objective: To analyze and find key insights from the dataset

About the dataset: 
This [data](https://github.com/karthikdoijode/BikeSalesInteractiveDashboard-UsingExcel/blob/main/Excel%20Project%20Dataset.xlsx) we downloaded from Google which is having information on people living in 3 different region such as North America, Europe and Pacific. 

Data cleaning:
- We found few duplicates and removed from the dataset to get good results after analyzing. Here we first removed duplicates, and replaced M and S in marital status column to married and single and also replaced F and M of Sex column to Female and Male for better understanding
- We created a new column to bound age within a certain range, so we created 3 different group of age and filtered data using if and nested if conditions to name every age range we created


Conclusions:
- Built an interactive [dashboard](https://github.com/karthikdoijode/BikeSalesInteractiveDashboard-UsingExcel/blob/main/BikeSalesDashboard.xlsx) and found out few insights.
- It is evident that average income of both male and female is increasing after purchasing bike to commute.
- It is clear that people are using bike to commute for lesser distance like between 0-1 miles.
- It has proven that people who are between the age range of 31-54 are using bike much compared to other age group.
